## How to run locally

> **NOTE:** Right now I don't know what to do with env variables like GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, so for a short time use your own variables. I'll take care of it in a short time.


First clone the project to a local directory.

>For front end next app
```
cd paris
```
Install packages
```
yarn install
```
To start the server
```
yarn dev
```

>For back end express app
```
cd berlin
```
Install packages
```
npm install
```
Create your .env file and enter your Google oauth api credentials
```
touch .env
```
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
```
Run the back end server
```
npm run dev
```
