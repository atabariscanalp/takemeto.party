## What is this app going to do?

Well, we like listening to music right? 
So this app's main goal is listen to music **for free**,

### How?

After you completed the log in process, you will be redirected to home page,
in home page you will find a lot of rooms with tags like #jazz or #pop,
after you enter a room you will listen a music that room's current dj is playing.

### How these rooms work?

Well, as you can guess there will be 2 kind of users in a room. Dj and listener. Djs will stream music through our web player with connecting their accounts to Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud or other music apps. Every one hour there will be voting session for like 5 minutes and listeners in this room will select a new dj, and this loop will go on like that.

### You don't like the idea? or you have a suggestion?

Of course this is a simple description of the app and I'm open to new suggestions. Also there might be issues with music streaming platforms, but I don't want to leave without trying. You can reach me with your opinions on Twitter [@barisata](https://twitter.com/barisata11) or you can open a new discussion on [discussions](https://github.com/atabariscanalp/takemeto.party/discussions) to propose your ideas.

### Where you can find this app?

It will live on [takemeto.party](https://takemeto.party)

*I must say I have not configured the nginx and the server yet.*
